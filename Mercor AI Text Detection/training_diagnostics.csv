The sentences could be framed better and exude the fear of Emil's voice that aligns with the storyline. How I would write it. Whispers of Dawn - A Moment That Mattered (Headline) In the silence before the world wakes, there are moments that define us. The trenches were still - eerily still.

They were sons. Brothers. Humans. By noon the shelling returned. The war remembered its rage. But Emil never forgot that morning",0,0.6469320307155405,0.5,0.53,0.53
